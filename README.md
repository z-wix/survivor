## 18 Contestants, 39 Days, 1 Survivor!

If you have seen any season of Survivor you know that there are lots of factors that go into how someone ultimately wins the million dollars: winning challenges and immunity (outplay), finding advantages and using them strategically (outwit), and creating an alliance and gaining favor of the final jury (outlast). But sometimes it just seems like luck that someone ends up in the final and wins. So I wanted to find some stats behind all the players and season of Survivor to see if there are any variables that contribute to whether not not you can be the sole survivor.

### The Data

I found a survivor dataset that gives stats on each contestant for every season and those stats can range from the number of votes they get cast against them, or their wins/losses in challenges whether as a team or individual. Even Hidden Immunity idols are account for here. So the my plan is to try to see if there are some correlations between winning or getting to the final vote or even getting to the merge and these different stats for the players. There is also some demographic questions such as sex, age, and birthday that would be interesting to see some simple stats between the winners.

The raw dataset `survivor_data_contains_spoilers.csv` contains... well spoilers for every season. It will tell you the name and order of which the contestants were kicked out and who won that season SOOO in order to keep those of you who are looking at this (mostly this is just for myself to be honest) from seeing those spoilers I am going to be altering the names of the contestants.

I am using the `anonymizedf` package which will allow me to do many different techniques to anonymize the contestants. For example I am going to replace the names of the contestants with random names generated by this package, also I will cahnge the PID to be a random tokenized string of letters and numbers. Lastly I decided to change the Sex to non descriptive category labels like 'Sex 1, Sex 2, etc'. The purpose of this analysis to see what variables influence player performance and I don't want to ruin the fun of watching the show by showing the names or even the gender of those who perform well. But that being said, I have provided a `key.csv` which will store the key to finding out the real values behind the columns that I am altering. So if you want spoilers... then go at it ;). 

Alright so now that you know the general idea and know that I will do my best to avoid spoiling any details from the show let me show you a little data dictionary that came with the dataset and will be helpful in understanding the definitions of the variables:

| STATISTIC                               | Definition                                                                                                   | Additional notes   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
|                                          |                                                                                                         |                    |
| *Overall/ calculated advanced stats*     |                                                                                                             |                       |
| SurvAv                                 | Survival Average: An attempt to quantitate overall success in the three major scorable areas: challenges, Tribal Council/voting, and with the jury. SurvAv is the sum of ChW (challenges), wTCR (voting), and a scaled multiple of JV% (jury votes), or: SurvAv = ChW + wTCR + (6* JV%). ChW is a counting stat with no theoretical limit, but the highest totals are around 7, the highest possible wTCR is 7, and a unanimous jury vote earns 6 points, so the three components have roughly equal weight (for a finalist). |                                                        |
| SurvSc                                 | Survival Score: A different approach to an overall success score, while keeping the three major scorable areas: challenges, Tribal Council/voting, and jury. SurvSc is the sum of three ratios, each with a maximum of 1, so a perfect SurvSc score is 3.00. SurvSc = ChW% + TC% + JV%. In practice, an individual player has the most control over TC% and JV%, since ChW% includes tribal wins, but we do what we can.                                                                                                      |                                                        |
| NoJ                                    | "No Jury": Basically just SurvAv without the jury vote component. So, NoJ = ChW + wTCR.

| TotV                                   | Total Votes: Sum of all the votes cast at a particular Tribal Council (again, only first round, but includes votes voided by idols).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                        |
| TCA                                    | Tribal Council Appearances: Number of times the player has voted at Tribal Council. So for most Tribal Councils attended, 1 point. If a vote steal/"no vote" penalty is used, zero points, even if the player receives votes cast against them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                        |
| TC%                                    | Tribal Council Percent: An attempt at measuring Tribal Council success. TC% = (VFB - [VAP/TotV]) / TCA. A perfect score is 1.00 (voting someone out every time, while never receiving a vote against).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                        |
| wTCR                                   | weighted Tribal Council Ratio: A separate measure of Tribal Council success, scaled to a maximum score of 7.00. Penalizes VAP more heavily than TC% does. Formula is wTCR = (28 * VFB) / ((VAP + 4) * TCA)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                        |
| VFT                                    | Vote-free Tribals: Number of times a player has cast a vote at Tribal Council without receiving a vote against. Includes times in which the player had individual immunity. Does not include times when votes against were made, but voided by idols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                        |
| nonVFB                                 | non-Votes for Boot: The number of times the player voted incorrectly at Tribal Council. First round votes only, as with VFB. Taking the non-booted side in a planned split vote still gets you (dubious) credit here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                        |
