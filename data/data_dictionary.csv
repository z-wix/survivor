STATISTIC,Definition,Additional notes
,,
Overall/ calculated advanced stats,,
SurvAv,"Survival Average: An attempt to quantitate overall success in the three major scorable areas: challenges, Tribal Council/voting, and with the jury. SurvAv is the sum of ChW (challenges), wTCR (voting), and a scaled multiple of JV% (jury votes), or: SurvAv = ChW + wTCR + (6* JV%). ChW is a counting stat with no theoretical limit, but the highest totals are around 7, the highest possible wTCR is 7, and a unanimous jury vote earns 6 points, so the three components have roughly equal weight (for a finalist).",
SurvSc,"Survival Score: A different approach to an overall success score, while keeping the three major scorable areas: challenges, Tribal Council/voting, and jury. SurvSc is the sum of three ratios, each with a maximum of 1, so a perfect SurvSc score is 3.00. SurvSc = ChW% + TC% + JV%. In practice, an individual player has the most control over TC% and JV%, since ChW% includes tribal wins, but we do what we can.",
NoJ,"""No Jury"": Basically just SurvAv without the jury vote component. So, NoJ = ChW + wTCR. Used to compare scores between people ",
,,
Challenge-related stats,,
ChW,(fractional) Challenge Wins: An individual challenge win counts as 1 point. Participating in a 5-person tribal challenge win counts as 1/5 points (0.2). No points for sitting out. Second-place in a three-tribe ichallenge earns half-credit (0.1 for a five-person second-place finish). ,"Core stats used in SurvAv, SurvSc calculations in Bold"
ChA,"(fractional) Challenge Appearances: As with ChW, full credit (1 point) for an individual challenge, fractional credit for tribal/team challenges. Here, credit is assigned for everyone present, including those who sit out.",
ChW%,"(fractional) Challenge Win Percent: The ratio of wins to appearances, or ChW% = ChW/ChA.",
SO,"Sit-outs: Number of challenges sat out. Only counts officially sitting out before the challenge starts. If a player is exiled or otherwise not physically present while a challenge takes place, not counted here.",
InRCA,Individual Reward Challenge Appearances: Number of individual RCs competed in/present for.,
InRCW,Individual Reward Challenge Wins: Number of individual RCs won.,
InICA,Individual Immunity Challenge Appearances: Number of individual ICs competed in/present for.,
InICW,Individual Immunity Challenge Wins: Number of individual ICs won.,
InChA,"Total individual challenge appearances: Sum of individual RC and IC appearances, or InChA = InRCA + InICA",
InChW,"Total individual challenge wins: Sum of individual RC and IC wins, or InChW = InRCW + InICW",
InChW%,"Individual challenge win percent: Ratio of individual challenges won to appearances, or InChW% = InChW/ InChA",
TRCA,Tribal/team Reward Challenge Appearances: Number of tribal or team RCs competed in/present for.,
TRCW,Tribal/team Reward Challenge Wins: Number of tribal or teams RCs won (sitouts are not counted here).,
TICA,Tribal/team Immunity Challenge Appearances: Number of tribal or team ICs competed in/present for.,
TICW,"Tribal/team Immunity Challenge Wins: Number of tribal or team ICs won (again, sitouts are not counted).",
TChA,"Total tribal/team challenge appearances: Sum of tribal or team RC and IC appearances, or TChA = TRCA + TICA",
TChW,"Total tribal/team challenge wins: Sum of tribal or team RC and IC wins, or TChW = TRCW + TICW",
TChW%,"Tribal/team challenge win percent: Ratio of tribal or team challenges won to appearances, or TChW% = TChW/ TChA",
TrCh 2nd,"Tribal/team second-place finishes: When a tribe (or rarely a post-merge team) wins something such as immunity or a smaller reward for finishing in second place (out of three or four or more), that's counted here.",
TrCh 3rd,"Tribal/team third-place finishes: Very rare, but when a tribe/team wins something (immunity) for a third-place finish out of four or more teams, that's counted here. Let's hope we never have to track non-losing fourth-place finishes.",
,,
Tribal Council or voting-related stats,,
VFB,"Votes For Boot: Number of times in which the player cast a vote for the person voted out. In the case of ties and revotes, only counts the first round of voting, not revotes.","Core stats used in SurvAv, SurvSc calculations in Bold"
VAP,"Votes Against Player: The number of votes cast against the player. As with VFB, only first-round votes count. If an idol is played and cancels out those votes, no VAP is charged.",
TotV,"Total Votes: Sum of all the votes cast at a particular Tribal Council (again, only first round, but includes votes voided by idols).",
TCA,"Tribal Council Appearances: Number of times the player has voted at Tribal Council. So for most Tribal Councils attended, 1 point. If a vote steal/""no vote"" penalty is used, zero points, even if the player receives votes cast against them.",
TC%,"Tribal Council Percent: An attempt at measuring Tribal Council success. TC% = (VFB - [VAP/TotV]) / TCA. A perfect score is 1.00 (voting someone out every time, while never receiving a vote against).",
wTCR,"weighted Tribal Council Ratio: A separate measure of Tribal Council success, scaled to a maximum score of 7.00. Penalizes VAP more heavily than TC% does. Formula is wTCR = (28 * VFB) / ((VAP + 4) * TCA)",
VFT,"Vote-free Tribals: Number of times a player has cast a vote at Tribal Council without receiving a vote against. Includes times in which the player had individual immunity. Does not include times when votes against were made, but voided by idols.",
nonVFB,"non-Votes for Boot: The number of times the player voted incorrectly at Tribal Council. First round votes only, as with VFB. Taking the non-booted side in a planned split vote still gets you (dubious) credit here.",
VFB%,"Vote for Boot Percent: The frequency of voting correctly. Simple ratio of VFB to TCA, or VFB% = VFB/ TCA.",
nVFB%,"non-Vote for Boot Percent: The frequency of voting incorrectly, or nVFB% = nonVFB/ TCA.",
TVA,"Times voted against: The number of Tribal Councils at which the player received at least one vote (or the reverse of VFT), so TVA = TCA - VFT.",
VAT%,"Voted-Against Tribal Percent: The percent of Tribals attended at which the player received at least one vote, or VAT% = TVA/ TCA.",
NI VFT,"Non-immune Vote-Free Tribals: Same as Vote-Free Tribals, but only counts those at which the player was eligible to be voted against (did not have individual immunity). Calculated as: NI VFT = VFT - InICW",
NI VFT%,"Non-immune VFT%: The percentage of Tribals at which a player was eligible to receive votes, but did not. NI VFT% = (VFT - InICW) / (TCA - InICW)",
VVp,Votes voided by idol plays: The total number of votes cast against that player that were voided by an idol play.,
VAPi,"""Intended"" Votes Against Player: Takes VAP as calculated above, but adds back votes that were voided by idols, so VAPi = VAP + VVp",
,,
Jury-related stats,,
JVF,Jury Votes For: The number of votes to win a player received from the jurors.,"Core stats used in SurvAv, SurvSc calculations in Bold"
TotJ,"Total jurors: The total number of jurors who cast votes at Final Tribal Council (sorry, Neal Gottlieb).",
JV%,"Jury Vote Percent: The ratio of jury votes received to votes cast, or JV% = JVF/ TotJ",
,,
Supplemental stats,,
Days,Days played: Simple count of the days the contestant played until voted out. ,
Finish,"Place finished: For a winner, this will be 1. For everyone else, something bigger. For Edge of Extinction seasons, this is generally counted from the time they were voted out, but players who leave the Edge early get a lower placement. For Redemption Island seasons, placement is determined by the time the player left Redemption island (while it was active), then standard order of being voted out.",
Time,"Times played: For a player in their first season this will be 1, in their second season 2, their third season 3, and so on.",
Exile,"""Exile"" days played: Counts days on Exile Island, Redemption Island, Ghost Island, or Edge of Extinction - any days still technically in-game, but not present in the regular game.",
