### Exploratory Data Analysis

First let's take a look into our data and see if there are any distributions we should be concerned about before implementing some modeling

```{r}
head(survivors)

colnames(survivors)
```

```{r}
survivors %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = Season, y = Finish))
```
